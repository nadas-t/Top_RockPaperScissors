🪨✂️📄 Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript as part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

The purpose of this project is to practice basic JavaScript concepts including:

    Functions and return values

    Conditional statements (if/else, switch)

    Loops (for, while)

    Working with prompt(), alert(), and console.log()

    String manipulation and user input

    Game logic and flow control

This version of the game is played via the browser console (no GUI yet). It lets the user play against the computer in a best-of-five match.
